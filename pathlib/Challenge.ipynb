    "# Pathlib Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "For these challenges we will be getting familiar with the `pathlib` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This topic was inspired by our own Organizer, Chris May. He wrote an article on [getting started with pathlib](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/stop-working-so-hard-paths-get-started-pathlib/) which also prompted him to write a [field guide](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/documents/3/ES-Getting_Started_with_Pathlib.pdf) and [cheat sheet](https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/documents/2/pathlib_cheat_sheet-V1_200703.pdf). You can see his other articles and resources at https://everydaysuperpowers.dev. Feel free to look at the resources and the `pathlib` [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) as they serve as the basis for the exercises below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of Paths. The documentation states, \"*Path classes are divided between pure paths, which provide purely computational operations without I/O, and concrete paths, which inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations.*\" In other words,\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`PurePath`**: Performs path operations witout caring about what might actually be on the disk.\n",
    "* **`Path`**: Allows you to interact with files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `PurePath` and `Path` can be either Windows or Posix paths. Chances are that you will not need to worry about the operating system specific choice since `pathlib` will take care of all the specifics for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "One common shortcut to get the path of the current file is with the `__file__` variable. Due to how Jupyter Notebooks work, the `__file__` variable is not available, so it is mimmicked in the imports block. If you're not familiar with `__file__`, I suggest you look at [`__name__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html) and how python uses [dunder](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods) attributes and methods."
