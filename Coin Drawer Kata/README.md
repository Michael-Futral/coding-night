You work at the cashier of a cash-only store.
Customers don't like to carry coins with them, so they always pay in even dollar amounts.
You don't feel like counting change to the right amount, so you decide to write a program
that takes the change owed and tells you how many quarters/dimes/nickels/pennies you need
to get for the proper change.

- Write a program that will take the amount of change owed and tell you how many of each coin you
  need to provide the customer with the fewest coins necessary.
- But you realize you are low in some currency. Modify your program to start with a certain number
  of each coin and make change with what you have.
- Extra: account for a series of transactions.

Steps:

- create a purchase total
- determine how much change is owed
- determine how many coins to give
